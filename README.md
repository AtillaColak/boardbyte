## BoardByte 
create real-time datasets for your favorite tabletop game with boardbyte (chess, backgammon, and many more). 

These datasets can be used for purposes ranging from EDA to model training. 

## Games supported so far 
* Chess
* Backgammon
* Go 
* Checkers
* Connect Four

* Uno
* Catan
* Battleship

* Sudoku

## TODO 
* create optimized scraping (or collection if there is public api or of-sort endpoint) for multiple games.
* Then make the UI. 
* Get the domain boardbyte.space

probably vercel for now is fine.


* Should I do format conversion? Or just instructions for now good enough.
